# Hi there!

My name is Sean Williams, and I'm currently studying Computer Engineering as an undergraduate at Columbia University. I have a wide variety of passions relating to my major, and love to learn and tinker with computers in my spare time. There's not much to see here yet, but feel free to reach out, or check out my other socials or my resume at the links on the left. Thanks for visiting!
